✈️ Airline Route Analysis - README

📦 What We Have

We are working with raw data from three datasets:
	•	Flights: Q1 2019 flight data — includes date, origin, destination, distance, flight number, air time, occupancy rate
	•	Tickets: Q1 2019 ticket data — includes itinerary details and fare information
	•	Airports: Airport metadata — includes airport code, city, country, coordinates

🎯 Objective

To identify and recommend the top 5 round-trip airline routes to invest in, based on:
	•	Profitability
	•	Operational efficiency
	•	Reliability

We work under the scenario of helping an airline company evaluate opportunities to enter the US domestic market.

🧹 Step 1: Data Cleaning

✅ Data Type Validation

We started with identifying and converting incorrect data types. For instance:

Column	Current Type	Expected Type	Issue	Action
AIR_TIME	object	float64	Non-numeric/missing values	Remove non-numeric characters, convert
DISTANCE	object	float64	Same	Same
FL_DATE	object	datetime64	Needs format conversion	Use errors='coerce' to clean
ITIN_FARE	object	float64	Contains “$”, “,”, etc.	Remove symbols, convert to float

Used regex to identify non-numeric characters:

str_series = series.astype(str)
non_numeric = str_series.str.findall(r'[^0-9.-]')

Cleaned issues include:
	•	$, ***, nan, spelled-out numbers (“Twenty”)
	•	Converted missing values to pd.NA

⸻

🔍 Step 2: Filter Business-Relevant Data
	•	Remove canceled flights
	•	Keep only relevant airports (medium/large)

Benefits:
	•	Reduce size for faster processing
	•	Prevent misleading outliers

⸻

📊 Step 3: Outlier Detection & Quality Check
	•	Detected:
	•	Negative flight times/distances
	•	Outrageous fares ($38,400), 681 passengers per ticket
	•	Unrealistic delays (49 hours)
	•	Used IQR method and scatter plots (e.g. air_time vs distance, correlation = 0.97)

⸻

🛫 Step 4: Route_ID Generation

Why?

To standardize round-trip routes: JFK → ORD and ORD → JFK = JFK-ORD

Assumptions:
	•	Profit and demand are symmetric for round-trip directions
	•	No missing legs in route pair
	•	Direct flights only

Checked that airport codes in Flights and Tickets exist in Airports dataset before proceeding.

⸻

🧩 Step 5: Handling Missing Values

Key Columns:
	•	AIR_TIME, DISTANCE, ITIN_FARE, PASSENGERS

Strategy:
	•	Group by Route_ID
	•	If group has valid values, fill missing with median
	•	If mostly missing → drop the route

Assumptions:
	•	Data per route is normally/symmetrically distributed
	•	Median is preferred over mean (handles skewed data, avoids outlier influence)

Special Handling:
	•	If both ARR_DELAY and DEP_DELAY missing, set ARR_DELAY = 0
	•	Delete FL_DATE and OCCUPANCY_RATE due to low coverage or better usage elsewhere

⸻

🔗 Step 6: Table Joining

Feasibility Check:
	•	Route Overlap: ~99% overlap between Flights and Tickets
	•	Time Alignment: Both datasets = Q1 2019
	•	Airline Coverage: 20/26 (Flights), 20/21 (Tickets)

Aggregation Level:
	•	Granularity = Year, Quarter, Route_ID

Aggregation Methods:

{
  'DISTANCE': 'first',
  'AIR_TIME': 'mean',
  'DEP_DELAY': 'mean',
  'OCCUPANCY_RATE': 'mean',
  'FL_DATE': 'count'  # total flights = route activity
}

Joining Strategy:
	•	Flights + Airports (origin/dest) = Left Join
	•	Tickets + Airports = Left Join
	•	Final: Flights + Tickets = Inner Join on (Route_ID, Year, Quarter)

📈 Key Tasks

Task 1: Busiest Round-Trip Route
	•	Based on total number of round-trips per route

Task 2: Most Profitable Round-Trip Route
	•	Initial Metric: Total Profit → favors high-demand routes
	•	Final Metric: Avg Profit per Flight per Route per Quarter
	•	Balanced supply/demand view
	•	Revenue = (avg_fare / 2) * passengers

Task 3: Multi-Factor Route Evaluation
	•	Considerations:
	•	Total Profit & Margin
	•	Flight Frequency (Market Size)
	•	Occupancy Rate (Service & Competency)
	•	Delay Control (Risk & Customer Impact)

Task 4: Investment Recommendation
	•	Assumption: One plane per route → $90M × 5 = $450M
	•	Assumes equal seasonal profit; future steps could add seasonality and discount rate factors
	•	Must validate round-trip balance (e.g., JFK → ORD = ORD → JFK)

⸻

📝 Future Improvements
	•	Consider seasonality and dynamic demand
	•	Refine route balancing
	•	Introduce NPV/ROI calculations for aircraft investment
